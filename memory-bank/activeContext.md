# Active Context

This document details the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, and active decisions and considerations for the mcp-bitpanda project.

## Current Work Focus:
Implementing the initial set of MCP tools for interacting with the Bitpanda API, based on the "List" endpoints from the provided documentation.

## Recent Changes:
- Created the basic project directory structure (`src`, `src/tools`, `memory-bank`).
- Created core configuration files (`.clinerules`, `.gitignore`, `.prettierrc`, `eslint.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `README.md`).
- Installed necessary dependencies (`dotenv`, `axios`, `@types/dotenv`).
- Created the configuration module (`src/config.ts`).
- Created the main server file (`src/index.ts`).
- Created the tool registration hub (`src/tools/index.ts`).
- Implemented the following tools in `src/tools/`:
    - `list_trades` (`trades.ts`)
    - `list_asset_wallets` (`assetWallets.ts`)
    - `list_fiat_wallets` (`fiatWallets.ts`)
    - `list_fiat_transactions` (`fiatTransactions.ts`)
    - `list_crypto_wallets` (`cryptoWallets.ts`)
    - `list_crypto_transactions` (`cryptoTransactions.ts`)
    - `list_commodity_transactions` (`commodity.ts`)
- Updated `src/tools/index.ts` to import and register the implemented tools.

## Next Steps:
- Create the remaining core Memory Bank files (`progress.md`).
- Review all Memory Bank files for completeness and accuracy.
- Consider adding more tools based on other Bitpanda API endpoints (e.g., fetching specific trades, placing orders - though placing orders might require more complex handling and user interaction).
- Add unit and integration tests for the implemented tools.
- Refine error handling and input validation in tool handlers.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- The initial focus is on read-only endpoints to establish the basic server structure and API interaction pattern.
- Pagination is handled within the tool handlers using the `cursor` and `page_size` parameters.
- API key security is managed via environment variables.
- The output structure for each tool is defined based on the provided API documentation examples.
