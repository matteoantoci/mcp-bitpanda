# Progress

This document tracks what is currently working in the mcp-bitpanda project, what is left to build, the current status, and any known issues.

## What Works:
- The basic project structure is set up, including necessary directories and configuration files.
- Core dependencies (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `axios`, `zod`, `dotenv`) are installed.
- The configuration module (`src/config.ts`) for API key and base URL is implemented.
- The main server entry point (`src/index.ts`) is set up.
- The tool registration hub (`src/tools/index.ts`) is created and registers tools from `src/tools/`.
- The following initial "List" tools are implemented in `src/tools/` and registered:
    - `list_trades`
    - `list_asset_wallets`
    - `list_fiat_wallets`
    - `list_fiat_transactions`
    - `list_crypto_wallets`
    - `list_crypto_transactions`
    - `list_commodity_transactions`
- The core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`) have been created.
- Added `BITPANDA_API_V3_BASE_URL` in `src/config.ts` and updated `src/tools/ohlc.ts` & `src/tools/utils/assetUtils.ts` to use the v3 base URL.
- Corrected `src/tools/ohlc.ts` to use asset `pid` instead of `id` for the OHLC endpoint and updated `BitpandaAsset` type in `src/tools/utils/assetUtils.ts` to include `pid`.

## What's Left to Build:
- Implement additional tools for other Bitpanda API endpoints (e.g., fetching specific items, placing orders, etc.).
- Add comprehensive unit and integration tests for all tools.
- Refine error handling and add more specific input validation where necessary.
- Enhance documentation, especially in the `README.md`, to detail all available tools and their usage.
- Consider implementing more advanced features like rate limit handling or authentication methods beyond API key if required by other endpoints.

## Current Status:
The basic project structure is complete, and the initial set of read-only "List" tools for key account data (trades, wallets, transactions) has been implemented and registered. The core Memory Bank documentation is in place. The project is ready for further tool implementation and testing.

## Known Issues:
- No known issues with the implemented tools at this stage, but thorough testing is required.
- The TypeScript error regarding `server.name` in `src/index.ts` might be a type definition issue in the SDK and should be monitored during the build process.
